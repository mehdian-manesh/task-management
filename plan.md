# Plan mode

You are operating in PLAN-ONLY mode.

TASK:
<PUT YOUR REQUEST HERE>

RULES:
- Do NOT write, edit, or propose final code yet.
- Do NOT modify any files.
- Do NOT assume requirements that are not explicitly stated.

OBJECTIVES:
1. Analyze the task and the existing codebase conceptually.
2. Identify missing requirements, ambiguities, and risks.
3. Ask clarifying questions if needed BEFORE planning.
4. Produce a structured, step-by-step implementation plan.

PLAN FORMAT:
- Overview (what will be built / changed)
- Assumptions
- Open questions (must be answered before execution)
- Step-by-step plan:
  - Step number
  - Description
  - Files involved (paths if known)
  - Rationale
- Validation / testing strategy
- Rollback or safety considerations

IMPORTANT:
- Stop after producing the plan.
- Wait for explicit confirmation like: “Approved, proceed with implementation.”
